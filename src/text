-multiple route handlers - play with the code
-next()
-next function and errors along with the res.send()
-app.use("/route",rH,[rH1,rH2, rH3 ]);
-what is middleware
-How express js basically handles the request behind the scene
-Difference between app.use and app.all
app.use:
Used to register middleware that applies to all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, etc.) at a given path (and its subpaths).
app.all
Used to handle all HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) at an exact route.

Feature	               app.use()	                     app.all()
Matches all methods	   ✅ Yes	                        ✅ Yes
Path matching	       ✅ Prefix match (e.g. /api/*)	    ❌ Exact only (e.g. /api)
Sub-paths	           ✅ Yes	                        ❌ No
Use case	          Middleware (logging, auth, etc.)	         Catch-all route handler
Can send response?	    ❌ Not typically (but can)	     ✅ Yes

-what is middleware and why we need it
Middleware is a function that gets access to the request (req), response (res), and the next function (next) in the cycle of handling a request.
Middleware lets you hook into the request-response cycle and do things before the final response is sent.
Middleware is:

A function that runs before your final response.

Used to process, protect, or modify requests/responses.

Essential to build clean, modular, and secure Express apps.

-write a dummy auth middleware for admin
-write a dummy auth middleware for all the user routes, except /user/login
-error handling using app.use("/",(err,res,req,next)={});
and it is used at the end of code
-create a free cluster on mongodb official website(Mongo atlas)
-install mongoose library
-connect your application to the database "connection-url/devTinder"
-call the connectDB function and connect the database before starting the application on 3000
-create a user schema and user Model
-create POST/signup using API to add data to the database
-push some documents by api call from postman
-error handling using try and catch
-what is the difference between json and javascript object
-Add the express.json middleware to your app
-make your signup api dynamic to receive data from the end user
-User.findOne with dulplicate email ids, which object returned
-API- get user by email
-API- feed api - GET/FEED- get all the data from the user database
-API- get user by id
-create delete user api
-diffrence between patch and put
-api- update a user
-Explore the mongoose documentation for Model methods
-what are the options in a Model.findOneAndUpdate method, and explore about it.
